# Stayfy

An online homestay booking app built with ReactJS (front-end), NodeJS (API services), and Firestore (database)

Take a look: [stayfy.vercel.app/](https://stayfy.vercel.app/)

The back-end git source: [API services](https://github.com/truongngocxit/stayfy-backend)

## Overview

### Front-end
<<<<<<< HEAD

- For JavaScript libraries, I used ReactJS and its related technologies such as Redux Toolkit and React Router
- I like pure CSS/SCSS so I avoid using CSS framework. For components that may take to long to rebuild and customize, such as the range picker, I resorted to [Ant Design's](https://ant.design/docs/react/customize-theme/) library.

### Back-end

- My NodeJS knowledge is limited so what I was aiming at is a workable API backend that is able communicate to the server, do some length query, and process some data for my front-end.
- I also use ExpressJS as the framework

### Database

- I relied on [Firestore](https://console.firebase.google.com/u/0/project/stayfy-d4fc1/firestore/data/~2F). But the more I go deep into it, I realized that its querying capabilities are limited. If possible, I would like to switch to MongoDB

### Design

- I basically replicated [AirBnB's](https://www.airbnb.com/) website and took some other inspirations from [Booking's](https://www.booking.com/). Nevertheless, I built everything from scratch myself.

# I'm searching for a fresher opportunity

I am also searching for a React fresher/intern job. I am work-oriented and can self-learn new things quickly. As an ex-marketer, I can also design and write (in both Vietnamese & English) decently. If you have any opportunity, please contact me:
